# Website Testing Dashboard - Service Layer

"Website Testing Dashboard" project centralizes the software testing process. This project allows the testing team and development team to have access to the test cases at the same time. It also allows other parties such as managers to check the progress of the tests and fixes. By keeping the data centralized we can avoid various revisions, file transfer process and decrease the error.

This repository serves as a codebase for development of a service layer for "Website Testing Dashboard" project. The service layer is the layer located between the user interface and database. It transfers the data between user interface and database and vice versa.
